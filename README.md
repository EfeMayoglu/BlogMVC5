This my first project in ASP .NET MVC 5.
I made this project to learn how ASP .NET works and because maybe in future someone will use that system in his own blog. 
Project doesn't include database. When compiled it throws unhandled exception.
If you want to compile on your own you have to add migrations to project.
Sorry for inconvenience.
